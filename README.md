# Electricity Trading Strategy

## Overview
Aim: To analyze intraday electricity price data in the Great Britain (GB) electricity market over a recent week (01/09/2024 - 08/09/2024). The goal is to identify volatility patterns and propose a simple trading strategy to capitalize on these patterns.

This repository contains a trading strategy designed to capitalize on price discrepancies between intraday and day-ahead electricity prices in the UK market. The strategy utilizes moving averages, volume data, and historical price patterns to generate buy and sell signals.
